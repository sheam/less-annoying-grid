# less-annoying-grid
An editable data grid that is meant for multiple scenarios.

This isn't meant as a quick way to show data.
Most large projects tend to use grids in a way specific to their data and needs.
So using a grid that works well out of the box always ends up causing pain long term.

This grid is used in a production application with multiple use cases.
So hopefully it can solve most of your needs out of the box. If there is a scenario that is
is needed by your application that is not covered, feel free to submit a pull-request.

For development, there is a less-annoying-grid-samples project which can be linked with this project.
