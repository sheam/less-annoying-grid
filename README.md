# less-annoying-grid
A react based grid that doesn't get in your way.

This isn't meant as a quick way to show data. 
Most large projects tend to use grids in a way specific to their data and needs.
So using a grid that works well out of the box always ends up causing pain long term.
This grid is mean to be unopinionated, so you can mold it to your needs.
